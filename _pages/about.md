I am a PhD student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) Lille within the [MODAL](https://team.inria.fr/modal/) team under the supervision of [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/). I am also affiliated with University College of London through the [Inria-London Programme](http://london.inria.fr/home/).
My research interests include PAC-Bayes learning, Online Learning, Optimisation and Optimal Transport.

Prior to starting my PhD, I have studied Mathematics and Computer Science at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).
