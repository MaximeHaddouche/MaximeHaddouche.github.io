I am a postdoctorate fellow at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) Paris within the [SIERRA](https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/) team, in collaboration with [Umut Simsekli](https://www.di.ens.fr/umut.simsekli/). Before that, I was part of the [Inria-London Programme](http://london.inria.fr/home/), a joint programme between Inria and University College of London for my PhD Thesis entitled [PAC-Bayes Learning From An Optimisation Perspective](../files/139903_HADDOUCHE_2024_archivage-2.pdf) under the supervision of [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/). 

My research focuses on the links between the generalisation ability of modern machine learning algorithms and the benefits gained during their training, or optimisation phase. To investigate those links, I am interested in PAC-Bayes learning, Online Learning, convec and nonconvex Optimisation as well as Optimal Transport.
